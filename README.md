XnaCompiledResources
====================

These are just a bunch of resources compiled in XNA, for use in Monogame

The content pipeline in Monogame doesn't handle a few things yet, like spritefont files.  They still have to be compiled in visual studio 2010 and XNA.  This project has a few resources that can be reused as submodules of different projects.

idunno, this is a pretty stupid idea, but it works and it's better than anything else I can think of.

Cheers!
